Context:

1. We saw company is growing from a founder-led/referral engine to ad-driven, cold outreach model.
2. Due to lack of qualification logic, ownership and CRM discipline, the leads are falling.

Part 1: Funnel Design + CRM Structuring

1.1 Funnel Design Simulation


 Stage           | Definition                                                                
 --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   Lead          | Someone who signed up through a form, ad, or event                        
   MQL           | Engaged lead  opened emails, downloaded whitepaper, visited pricing page  
   SQL           | Qualified by sales — someone who shows buying intent                      
   Opportunity   | In pipeline — budget/timeline confirmed, decision maker identified        
   Customer      | Paid for the product and closing done


   From → To            |   Upgrade Criteria                                                           |  Owner            
 ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- 
 Lead → MQL             | Matches ICP + engaged (e.g., clicked ad, replied to email, attended webinar) |   Marketing       
 MQL → SQL              | Booked a discovery call / demo  responds positively to outbound              |   SDR/BDR         
 SQL → Opportunity      | Need, budget, timeline, authority confirmed; proposal requested              |   Sales AE        
 Opportunity → Customer | Signed contract + payment cleared + onboarding scheduled                     |   Sales AE → CS   


We will add a Bonus Stage here, which is Dormant Gold. Dormant Gold (DG) is a stage for leads that previously engaged but went cold without rejecting.


DG Activation Criteria:

 Trigger to enter DG                       | Ownership to monitor | Next steps                          
------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- 
SQL or Opp with no activity for 14–30 days | SDR / Sales          | Enters DG for targeted reactivation 
No clear “not interested” or “lost” status | SDR                  | Reassigned for win-back flow        

Success Metrices:

% of Dormant Gold leads converted to SQL or Opp within 30 days of reactivation

Strategic Implementation:

Dormant Gold protects your CAC by salvaging past effort.
You already paid to acquire the lead — why not give it a second life?

Part 2: Nurturing Mechanism Design

Goal: Convert “cold leads” into warm conversations without spamming.
Approach: Use intent-based drip tracks with channel-persona fit, empathy-led messaging, and smart automation.

For high Intent Leads
Profile: Booked a demo → didn’t convert
They’re interested but something blocked them (timing, budget, doubt). These leads deserve a personal, context-rich revive.

 Element       | Strategy                                                           
 ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
   Frequency   | 3 touchpoints in 10–14 days                                        
   Channels    | Email → LinkedIn DM → WhatsApp (if applicable)                     
   Content     | - Founder note: “You seemed like a great fit, was the timing off?” 

2. For Mid Intent Lead
Profile: Downloaded a whitepaper / joined a webinar
They’re curious but haven’t engaged directly — we want to educate, build trust, and trigger a low-friction micro-conversion.

 Element       | Strategy                                               
 ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ 
   Frequency   | Weekly touch (over 3–4 weeks)                          
   Channels    | Email + Retargeting Ads (LinkedIn, YouTube)            
   Content     | - Playbook or teardown of how another company solved X 

3. For Low Intent Lead
Profile: Subscribed to newsletter
No clear buying signal — nurture gently with value-first insights to keep the brand warm and earn a later click.

 Element       | Strategy                       
 ------------- | ------------------------------ 
   Frequency   | Bi-weekly                      
   Channels    | Email only                     
   Content     | - Industry insights newsletter 

Bonus Stage:  Smart Routing Tip
Leads that click 2+ nurturing emails or spend 60+ sec on content → trigger automatic MQL upgrade via CRM rule or Zapier.


Part 3: Funnel Analytics & CAC Optimization

Objective: Cut CAC by 40% next quarter

Q1: Which channel is underperforming? Why?
 Facebook Ads is underperforming.

₹3,000 is the Cost per Conversion

2. 1% Conversion Rate

3. With 3000 leads, conversion quality is low, driving up CAC.

This suggests that there is either poor targeting or ineffective creative/copy.

Q2: Two Experiments to Improve Facebook Performance?

1. Audience Segmentation & Retargeting Loop
Problem: Cold top-funnel targeting is inefficient.

 Action to take:

Creating custom audiences which is based on site visitors, engaged users or subscribers.

2. Setting up retargeting campaigns only for these warm audiences with personalized CTAs.

Adding the Layers in demographics + job titles to refine ICP.
Here ICP stands for Ideal Customer Profile. In the context of business and sales, an ICP is a detailed description of the type of customer that would benefit the most from a company's products or services.

 What is our goal: Lift conversion rate from 1% → 2.5%
 Tools to use: Meta Ads Manager + CRM retarget sync

2. Creative Personalization A/B Test
Problem: Generic creative lowers engagement → bad lead quality.

Action to take:

A/B test 3 new ad creatives:

2. Case study from a similar-size company

For founder-led ad we can put a reel or visual video.

Problem-framing carousel: “Struggling with X? Here's how we solved it.”

Match creatives to intent signals (cold, warm, high-ICP)

 What is our goal: Increase CTR → better lead intent
 Tools to use : Meta + Copy.ai + Jasper for fast variations

Q3: CAC:LTV Dashboard Proposal

What is our goal: Shift from siloed channel views → full-funnel performance clarity
Audience: Growth Manager, CEO, Media Lead that are paid

Dashboard Metrics:

 Metric                              | Why It Matters                                
 ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- 
 CAC per channel                     | Track where efficiency drops                  
 LTV per channel                     | Not all CACs are equal if LTV is higher       
 CAC\:LTV ratio                      | Golden metric (target: >3x for SaaS)          
 Conversion Rate (Lead → SQL → Cust) | See if drop-off is a sales issue, not channel 
 Lead Quality Score (avg per source) | Predictive quality — from CRM scoring         
 Channel ROI Trend (30d/90d)         | See decay or growth in effectiveness          
 Attribution Breakdown (First/Last)  | Understand where actual conversion is seeded  

Who should see it weekly?

 Role            | Focus                                             
 --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- 
   CEO           | CAC\:LTV, spend vs growth, source ROI             
   Growth Lead   | Micro-metrics, channel tuning, conversion paths   
   Sales Lead    | SQL quality by source, feedback loop to marketing 
   Paid Media    | Ad performance, CTR → SQL pipeline effectiveness  


Part 4: Strategic Summary (Max 200 Words)

My funnel design philosophy centers around clarity, context, and conversion. A funnel isn’t just a flowchart. It’s a reflection of how trust is built across stages. I believe every stage should earn its transition through intent signals, not assumptions. When done right, the funnel becomes a system where both sales and marketing feel ownership and visibility.

That said, I don’t treat humans like segments in a CRM. People ghost, priorities shift, and intent fluctuates. That’s where balancing structure with flexibility matters. I design for edge cases , like adding a “Dormant Gold” stage for paused conversations  and build in buffers that allow real-world unpredictability without losing track.

Data storytelling is what converts friction into alignment. Raw metrics don’t shift decisions  but a story that shows how CAC is rising due to low MQL quality, or how one campaign doubled LTV, gets buy-in. I use data to give narrative to growth problems, helping founders or teams zoom out from tasks and see the bigger picture.

In short, my approach is part architect, part translator  building systems that scale without losing the human signal inside the data.
